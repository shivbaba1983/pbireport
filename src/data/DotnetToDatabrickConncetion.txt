I need to connect  From On perm DotNet 4.8 C# application  to databrick database to pull table data, how to this
ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç You want your on-premises .NET Framework 4.8 (C#) application to connect to Databricks and pull table data.

There are a few supported ways to connect from .NET:

üîë 1. Use Databricks SQL (ODBC/JDBC) Connector

Databricks exposes a SQL Warehouse (formerly SQL endpoint) which supports ODBC/JDBC.

For .NET Framework, ODBC is the most straightforward.

Steps:

Enable SQL Warehouse

In your Databricks workspace, go to SQL Warehouses and create/start one.

Get the Server Hostname, HTTP Path, and Personal Access Token (PAT) from SQL Endpoints ‚Üí Connection Details.

Install the ODBC driver

Download the Databricks ODBC driver (Simba) from the Databricks portal.

Install it on your on-prem server where your .NET app runs.

Configure DSN (optional)

Open ODBC Data Sources (64-bit) ‚Üí Add new DSN with the Simba Databricks driver.

Provide:

Host: <your-databricks-host>.cloud.databricks.com

HTTP Path: from SQL Warehouse

Authentication: Token

Token: your PAT

Connect via C# (ODBC)

using System;
using System.Data.Odbc;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "DSN=DatabricksDSN;";
        
        using (OdbcConnection conn = new OdbcConnection(connectionString))
        {
            conn.Open();
            string sql = "SELECT * FROM my_catalog.my_schema.my_table LIMIT 10";
            
            using (OdbcCommand cmd = new OdbcCommand(sql, conn))
            using (OdbcDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
            {
                while (reader.Read())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(reader[0].ToString());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


‚úÖ This works with ADO.NET via ODBC.

üîë 2. Use Databricks REST API (if no ODBC allowed)

You can query tables with SQL Statements REST API.

Send HTTPS requests with your PAT.

Parse JSON results in .NET.

Example C# (HttpClient):
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        string token = "<DATABRICKS_PAT>";
        string host = "<your-databricks-host>.cloud.databricks.com";
        string endpoint = $"https://{host}/api/2.0/sql/statements/";

        using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
        {
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);

            string payload = "{\"statement\": \"SELECT * FROM my_catalog.my_schema.my_table LIMIT 10\"}";

            var content = new StringContent(payload, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
            var response = await client.PostAsync(endpoint, content);

            string result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            Console.WriteLine(result);
        }
    }
}


Downside: You need to handle pagination, JSON parsing, etc.

üîë 3. Use JDBC Bridge (not common for .NET 4.8)

You could use a JDBC driver via a .NET-to-Java bridge, but it‚Äôs complex.

Usually avoided in .NET Framework.

‚úÖ Best practice: Use ODBC driver with SQL Warehouse.
That gives you standard ADO.NET access, just like SQL Server.

Do you want me to write you a working ODBC connection string (without DSN) so you don‚Äôt need to configure a DSN manually, just keep it in your C# app?

You said:
Error:IM2 Microsoft [ODBC Driver manager] data source nname not found and no defulat driver specified
ChatGPT said:

That error üëÜ means your C# app is trying to use an ODBC DSN name (DSN=DatabricksDSN;) but either:

The DSN is not created, or

The Databricks ODBC driver (Simba) is not installed, or

You‚Äôre running in 32-bit vs 64-bit mismatch (your .NET 4.8 app is 32-bit but you installed only the 64-bit driver, or vice versa).

üîß Fix Options
‚úÖ Option 1: Create a DSN

Install the Simba Databricks ODBC Driver on your machine.

Open ODBC Data Sources (64-bit) (since .NET 4.8 apps usually run as 64-bit unless forced to x86).

Add a new DSN named DatabricksDSN.

Fill in Host, Port (443), HTTP Path, Auth = Token, and Token.

Try again with:

string connectionString = "DSN=DatabricksDSN;";

‚úÖ Option 2: DSN-Less Connection String (recommended)

Instead of creating a DSN, embed everything in your C# code:

using System;
using System.Data.Odbc;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = 
            "Driver={Simba Spark ODBC Driver};" +
            "Host=<your-databricks-host>.cloud.databricks.com;" +
            "Port=443;" +
            "HTTPPath=/sql/1.0/endpoints/<your-endpoint-id>;" +
            "AuthMech=3;" +
            "UID=token;" +
            "PWD=<your-personal-access-token>;" +
            "SSL=1;";

        using (OdbcConnection conn = new OdbcConnection(connectionString))
        {
            conn.Open();
            string sql = "SELECT * FROM my_catalog.my_schema.my_table LIMIT 10";
            
            using (OdbcCommand cmd = new OdbcCommand(sql, conn))
            using (OdbcDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
            {
                while (reader.Read())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(reader[0].ToString());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

‚ö†Ô∏è Check 32-bit vs 64-bit

If your app runs as x86, you must install the 32-bit driver and configure via ODBC Data Sources (32-bit).

If your app runs as AnyCPU / x64, install the 64-bit driver and use ODBC Data Sources (64-bit).

üëâ Do you want me to show you how to check whether your .NET 4.8 app is running in 32-bit or 64-bit, so you can match the driver correctly?

You said:
how to do this -> Open ODBC Data Sources (64-bit) ‚Üí Add new DSN with the Simba Databricks driver.?
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through this step by step. You only need to do this once on the machine where your .NET 4.8 app runs.

üõ† Steps to Create a DSN for Databricks
1. Install the Simba Databricks ODBC Driver

Go to your Databricks workspace.

SQL Warehouses ‚Üí pick a warehouse ‚Üí Connection details ‚Üí "Download ODBC driver".

Install it (choose 64-bit unless your app is forced to run x86).

2. Open ODBC Data Source Administrator

On Windows, press Start ‚Üí type ODBC Data Sources (64-bit) ‚Üí open it.
(‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt choose the 32-bit one unless your app is 32-bit).

3. Add New DSN

In the ODBC Data Source Administrator window:

Go to the System DSN tab (so all users can use it).

Click Add‚Ä¶.

In the list of drivers, select:
Simba Spark ODBC Driver (this is the Databricks driver).

Click Finish.

4. Configure DSN

You‚Äôll see a Simba Spark ODBC DSN Setup dialog. Fill it like this:

Data Source Name: DatabricksDSN (or any name, but match it in your code).

Host(s): <your-databricks-host>.cloud.databricks.com

Port: 443

HTTP Path: from the Databricks SQL Warehouse ‚Üí Connection details (looks like /sql/1.0/warehouses/xxxxx).

Authentication Mechanism: choose Token.

User Name: token

Password: your Databricks Personal Access Token (PAT).

SSL Options: check Enable SSL.

5. Test Connection

Click Test.

If everything is correct, you‚Äôll see Connection Successful.

6. Use in Your C# Code

Now you can connect with:

string connectionString = "DSN=DatabricksDSN;";


And the rest of your ADO.NET ODBC code stays the same.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:

If you don‚Äôt see Simba Spark ODBC Driver in the list ‚Üí the driver isn‚Äôt installed correctly (maybe you grabbed 32-bit instead of 64-bit).

If your DSN name is DatabricksDSN, it must exactly match in your C# connection string.

üëâ Do you want me to also show you how to skip DSN entirely (DSN-less connection string), so you don‚Äôt depend on machine ODBC setup? That way deployment is easier.

ChatGPT said:

Got it üëç That error:

Unexpected response from server during a HTTP connection: Could not resolve host for client socket

means the Simba ODBC driver can‚Äôt reach your Databricks workspace host. This is almost always because of a wrong Hostname or HTTP Path. Let‚Äôs fix it step by step:

‚úÖ Things to Double Check
1. Correct Hostname

Open Databricks workspace ‚Üí SQL Warehouses ‚Üí pick your warehouse ‚Üí Connection details.

The Server Hostname should look like:

<something>.databricks.com


or (if on AWS region-specific):

<something>.<region>.databricks.azure.com


Put exactly that into Host(s) in the ODBC DSN.
‚ùå Do not include https:// or any slashes.
‚úÖ Example: adb-1234567890123456.7.azuredatabricks.net

2. Correct HTTP Path

In the same Connection details window, copy the HTTP Path.
It usually looks like:

/sql/1.0/warehouses/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Paste this into the ODBC setup HTTP Path field exactly.

3. Network/DNS Resolution

From your machine, test DNS resolution:

nslookup adb-1234567890123456.7.azuredatabricks.net


If it fails, your on-prem network/firewall might be blocking access.

You also need port 443 (HTTPS) open outbound.

4. Token

Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in Databricks (User Settings ‚Üí Access Tokens).

Enter:

User Name: token

Password: <your-PAT>

5. Example Correct DSN-less Connection String

If you prefer skipping DSN, try this in your C#:

string connectionString =
    "Driver={Simba Spark ODBC Driver};" +
    "Host=adb-1234567890123456.7.azuredatabricks.net;" +
    "Port=443;" +
    "HTTPPath=/sql/1.0/warehouses/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;" +
    "SSL=1;" +
    "AuthMech=3;" +
    "UID=token;" +
    "PWD=<your-personal-access-token>;";


‚ö° Key:

Host = the "Server Hostname" from Databricks ‚Üí no https://.

HTTPPath = the full path from Databricks connection details.

AuthMech=3, UID=token, PWD=PAT ‚Üí required for token auth.

üëâ Can you paste me the Server Hostname and HTTP Path values you‚Äôre currently using (just with sensitive parts masked), so I can verify the exact format for your case?

You said:
it is <something>.azuredatabricks.net
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ‚Äî that tells me you‚Äôre on Azure Databricks üëç

So your DSN setup / connection string should look like this:

‚úÖ ODBC DSN Setup

When you add a Simba Spark ODBC Driver DSN:

Data Source Name: DatabricksDSN

Host(s):

<something>.azuredatabricks.net


(‚ö†Ô∏è no https://, no slashes ‚Äî just the hostname)

Port:

443


HTTP Path: copy this from your Databricks SQL Warehouse ‚Üí Connection Details
Example:




Authentication Mechanism: Token

User Name: token

Password: <your-personal-access-token>

SSL: enabled

Then click Test. ‚úÖ

‚úÖ DSN-less Connection String (C# Example)

If you don‚Äôt want to depend on DSN, you can connect directly:

string connectionString =
    "Driver={Simba Spark ODBC Driver};" +
    "Host=<something>.azuredatabricks.net;" +
    "Port=443;" +
    "HTTPPath=;" +
    "SSL=1;" +
    "AuthMech=3;" +
    "UID=token;" +
    "PWD=<your-personal-access-token>;";

using (OdbcConnection conn = new OdbcConnection(connectionString))
{
    conn.Open();
    string sql = "SELECT * FROM my_catalog.my_schema.my_table LIMIT 10";

    using (OdbcCommand cmd = new OdbcCommand(sql, conn))
    using (OdbcDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
    {
        while (reader.Read())
        {
            Console.WriteLine(reader[0].ToString());
        }
    }
}

‚ö†Ô∏è Common Gotchas

Host must be exactly xxxx.azuredatabricks.net ‚Üí no https://.

HTTPPath must come from the SQL Warehouse connection details ‚Üí not from the workspace URL.

If your warehouse is stopped, the connection will fail ‚Üí make sure it‚Äôs running.

Ensure outbound port 443 is open from your on-prem server.

üëâ Do you want me to show you where exactly in the Databricks UI you‚Äôll find the Server Hostname and HTTP Path (with screenshots-style instructions)?

ChatGPT can make mista



Great question üëç ‚Äî short answer: no, you cannot connect with just the Databricks token.

Here‚Äôs why:

üîë How Databricks Authentication Works

The token (Personal Access Token, PAT) is just your credential.

To actually connect, you must also tell the driver or API where to connect ‚Üí that means you still need:

Server Hostname (e.g. xxxx.azuredatabricks.net)

HTTP Path (specific SQL Warehouse endpoint)

Port (443, for HTTPS)

The ODBC driver (Simba Spark ODBC) requires all of those parameters in order to establish a TLS/HTTP connection.

‚úÖ Alternatives with Token-only Authentication
1. Databricks REST API

If you want to use only the token without connection string complexity, you can call the SQL Statement Execution REST API directly:

using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        string token = "<your-PAT>";
        string hostname = "<something>.azuredatabricks.net";   // still needed
        string httpPath = "/sql/1.0/warehouses/1234abcd5678efgh"; // still needed
        string endpoint = $"https://{hostname}/api/2.0/sql/statements/";

        using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
        {
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);

            string payload = "{\"statement\": \"SELECT * FROM my_catalog.my_schema.my_table LIMIT 10\", \"warehouse_id\": \"1234abcd5678efgh\"}";

            var content = new StringContent(payload, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");
            var response = await client.PostAsync(endpoint, content);

            string result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
            Console.WriteLine(result);
        }
    }
}


‚ö†Ô∏è Even here, you still need the warehouse_id / HTTP Path to tell Databricks which compute cluster (SQL Warehouse) should execute the query.

2. ODBC / JDBC

With ODBC/JDBC, the token is used in place of username/password,
but you still must provide host + HTTP Path.

üöÄ Bottom line

The token alone is not enough.

You always need at least host + SQL Warehouse HTTP Path + token.

üëâ Do you want me to show you a minimal working sample using only hostname + token + warehouse id (no DSN, no long connection string) in your .NET app?
