‚úÖ Answers & Explanations
#	Answer(s)	Explanation
1	A, C	Snowflake separates compute & storage; it also uses a shared-nothing concept.
2	A, B	Time Travel and Fail-safe are core data protection features.
3	B	A virtual warehouse is a compute cluster to process queries.
4	A, D	You load semi-structured data via COPY INTO ... FROM <stage>.
5	A, B, D	Role hierarchy, masking policies, network policies are valid security features.
6	A, C	You can query past states and roll back within retention windows.
7	B, D	Fail-safe kicks in after Time Travel retention, and is managed by Snowflake.
8	A, B, C	You need bucket URL, region, and credentials / IAM role.
9	A, B, D	You can replicate DBs, across regions, and failover between accounts.
10	A, C	FLATTEN() (often via LATERAL FLATTEN()) is used to expand JSON arrays.
11	A	Clustering helps optimize queries by reducing scanned micro-partitions.
12	A, B, D	Use of SELECT * is not recommended for large tables.
13	A, B	Data sharing shares live data, not compute or DML rights inherently.
14	A, B	Internal = inside Snowflake, external = cloud storage outside.
15	A, B	Snowflake encrypts data at rest & in transit; metadata is also encrypted.
16	A, B, C, D	Snowflake supports JSON, XML, Avro, Parquet and more semi-structured formats.
17	B, C	Zero-copy cloning does not duplicate data initially; clones can diverge.
18	A, B, C	Historical versions & micro-partitions contribute to storage size.
19	A, B	Auto-suspend / monitors help control compute costs.
20	B, C	You define a masking policy then apply it to a column via ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN.
